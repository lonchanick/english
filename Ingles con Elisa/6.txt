real dads aren't always that great you know.
I got a real dad and the guy is out of his mind.
He has been telling me what to do my whole life.
he never lets me figure stuff out on my own.
a lot of dads are like that.
that's why so many people grow up nuts.
look at this guy over here he was probably a nice little boy just like you.
Then his dad messed his mind up.
now look at him.
hey buddy who won the jets game you know? who cares.
let it go pal. he can't control you enymore.
