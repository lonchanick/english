near the end of the Bible are 21 letters
from leaders of the early Jesus Movement

they were written to small church
communities in cities throughout the
Roman world 

now writing letters took a
lot of money and <<efford in the ancient world>> 
and so each one was crafted carefully from beginning to end
and that means we should read them as one whole literary work 

so let's talk about how to read New Testament letters in their
literary context 

<<of all the (About the)>> early Christian leaders the Apostle Paul wrote the most letters we have 13 in the New Testament <<opt??>> imagine him alone in his study writing long theological essays

but Paul didn't work or write
alone in fact he often names people from his team who helped him produce the letters

alright like Timothy or Silas

yeah Paul was constantly with his
missionary teammates on the road working out ideas as they talked and debated and talked together and Paul would have collected speeches poems and prayers in notebooks

like the ones he mentions in a second letter to Timmy

right and so Paul would get the right teammates in a room and start pulling together old and new material 

then they would hire a professional scribe and start creating drafts until they were satisfied with how it worked together as one whole

then mail it off 

yeah, the letter would be given to a trusted team<<mate-men>> who would also be given instructions on how to perform it before the recipients

perform it like read it aloud

yeah most people back then didn't read

until Paul mentions this more than once in his letters that they were designed to be heard

which is why they often sound like written speeches 

so it's important for us to read and listen to these letters from beginning to end too so we can appreciate how each part contributes to the <<whole>>

exactly, now every culture has its own practice for how to organize a letter and in the first century there was a standard format 

you have the opening
which names the author and then the
receiver then a prayer of thanks <<who - so they >> are greeting 

then comes the body of the letter

this part is the main reason for
writing in the first place what the
receive is supposed to know or do
something about 

right and then comes the
conclusion which could have greetings travel plans a final request or a prayer

so it's helpful to see how a New Testament letter breaks down into these parts 

right so let's take for example
Paul's letter to the Ephesians 

okay there's the opening and then a long Thanksgiving prayer to God 

and in the center of this opening prayer Paul introduces the main idea of the whole letter it's about God's plan 

to unite together all things in heaven and earth in Messiah Jesus but what <<does that - is that>> mean

well as we move into the body of the
letter Paul is going to repeat and
unpack this rich idea 

right but in the body of the letter it's easy to get lost and lose track what Paul's even talking about

totally I mean the letter to the
Ephesians has about 3,000 words 

and that one's short compared to his other letters 

but remember Paul wrote these
letters to be heard aloud and so he
usually gives clues to the progression of thought with transition words like
therefore or because of this or so then

okay so the body of Ephesians breaks
down to a lot of paragraphs but they all begin with these transition words 

right and each paragraph has its own main idea
so the first one is about how the Risen Jesus is king of everything and everyone 

and as for you that is non-israelites
you are now included in the new humanity gods <<creating>>

therefore God's one new
family consists of people from all nations 

so God has unified a new
humanity in Jesus that's the core idea here 

right and that theme unites all of the paragraphs and chapters 1 through 3

then we come to chapter 4 and we get a really significant transition

there for

yeah that transition word is actually a hinged <<between>>
the first and second half of the letter

God's unified a new humanity in Jesus

therefore what?

great question, let's keep going and we'll summarize the paragraphs of chapter <<four>>

God's one new humanity is really diverse 

so 

we must live together as God's new creation and that therefore requires that we learn how to love and forgive each other because we are one 

this section is all about living in unity 

right and so you can see now how all the parts of the letter fit together into one flow of thought 

God's unified a new humanity in Jesus therefore live in a way that fosters that unity 

seeing it broken down like this is really helpful it's like a road map so I don't get lost 

right and you can read every New Testament letter this way 

break it down into smaller parts to see the message of each paragraph and then 

trace repeated ideas and transition words to see how they all connect back together 

then you'll see how the Apostles brilliantly combined
all of the pieces into a literary whole

that spoke to Jesus's first followers and can still speak to us today
