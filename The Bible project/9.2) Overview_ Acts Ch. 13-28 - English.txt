The book of Acts.
In the first video we
watched Luke open the book
by showing us how the
Risen Jesus was exalted
as the King of the world.
 
He promised to send the Holy Spirit
as His own personal presence
to empower His followers,
to go out into the world
and bear witness to the
good news about His Kingdom,
until he would return one day.

And so the movement began
in Jerusalem as the Spirit came
and form Jesus'
followers into the new temple
promised by the scriptural prophets.

But this generated conflict
with the leaders of Jerusalem.
And so it led to the
persecution of the Christians.
but the Spirit transformed it into good:
it actually became the means
by which the originally (Jewish) communities
were pushed outside Jerusalem
to become a multi-ethnic,
international movement.

And the flagship Church of this
diverse Jesus' movement was an Antioch,
the largest city in that
part of the Roman Empire.

So we left the story
with Barnabas and Paul
serving in Antioch church.
And the Spirit prompts the church
to send them on a missionary journey,
which opens up a whole
new section of the book,
the stories about Paul and his co-workers
traveling to different cities
around the Roman Empire
announcing the good
news that Jesus is King.

The first mission is into the interior
of what's called Asia Minor
found in modern Turkey.
And it ends with an important
meeting of the Apostles back in Jerusalem.

The second mission is through Asia Minor
and then into ancient Greece.
And then the third mission is
through that same territory again
and it concludes with Paul's
journey all the way back to Jerusalem.

Now in recounting all these stories
Luke has highlighted a
number of important themes
by repeating them. 
So first is the
continued mission to Israel;

whenever Paul enters a new city
he always goes first
to the Jewish synagogue
to share about the risen King Jesus
and how He's forming a
new (multi)-ethnic family of God.

The most often lots of people come
to recognize Jesus as the Messiah
but some oppose Paul.
Sometimes they even throw him
out of town as a dangerous rebel
who opposes the 
Torah and Jewish tradition.

And this tension
(culminates) after the first journey
leading to an
important council in Jerusalem.
So Paul discovers that there
are some Jewish Christians in Antioch
and they're claiming
that unlless non-jewish people
become Jewish by
practicing circumcision, the Sabbath,
(obeying) the kosher food laws,
that they can't
become part of Jesus' family.

But Paul and Barnabas
they radically disagree.
And so they take the debate to
a Leadership Council in Jerusalem.
Now they're Peter, Paul and
James, the brother of Jesus
they all show from the
Scriptures and from their experience
that God's plan was always to include
the nations within His covenant people.

So they write a letter
requiring non-jewish Christians
to stop participating in
pagan temple sacrifices
but they don't require them to
adopt an (ethnically) (Jewish) identity
or obey the laws in the Torah.

Now this decision was groundbreaking
for the history of the Jesus Movement.
Jesus is the (Jewish) Messiah
but He's also the
risen King of all nations. 
And so once membership among His
people is not based on ethnic identity
or following the laws of the Torah;
it's based simply on trusting Jesus
and then following His teachings.

And it's this (multi)-ethnic
reality of the Jesus Movement
that leads us to the next theme
Luke wants us to see in the
missionary journeys, namely:
the clash of cultures
between the early Christians
and the greek and roman world.

Luke records multiple
clashes in Phillipy, Athens, (Ephesus).
Paul goes announces Jesus
as the revelation of the one true God
and as the King of the world
who shows up all other gods
and idols as powerless and (futile).

And his message is consistently viewed
as subversive to the Roman Way of life
and he gets accused of being
a dangerous social revolutionary.

These stories show how the multi-
ethnic, monotheistic Jesus communities
did not fit into any cultural
boxes known to the Roman people.
The ancient world had just
never seen anything like them.

And the Christians aroused
more than just suspicions.

Another theme Luke repeats is
how Paul and the Christians
are constantly being accused of rebellion
even treason against
Caesar, the Roman Emperor.

People heard Paul correctly:
he was announcing
that there's another King Jesus
and they also correctly saw that the
Christian Way of life was the challenge
to many Roman cultural values.
But every time Paul gets arrested
and interrogated before Roman officials
they don't see any
(threat) and he's (dismissed).

These stories show us the paradox
that the early church
presented to the world;
it was a (Jewish) messianic movement
but it was ethnically
diverse, full of communities
that treated men and women
and rich and poor and slave and free,
all as equals.
And they all gave their
allegiance to King Jesus alone
and no other god or king.

And so their very existence
it turned upside down the
core values of roman culture
but the Christians pose no military threat
because Jesus taught
them to be people of peace.

And so the only crime Paul and
the Christians can be accused of
is not conforming to the status quo.

The books final section
returns the focus to Paul's witness
spreading from Jerusalem to Rome.

His final missionary
journey ends back in Jerusalem
where his controversial
reputation precedes him.
He gets attacked by
(Jewish) people who think
that he's (betrayed) Israel which
attracts the attention of Roman soldiers
who think Paul's a terrorist
from (Egypt) starting a rebellion.
And so he gets arrested.

From here Paul is put on trial:
first before the Jewish leaders
of the Sanhedrin in Jerusalem
but then before a series
of Roman leaders in (and) [surya] cesar√©a.
There's governor Felix
who puts Paul off for
the next governor Festus
who eventually brings
Paul before King Agrippa.
He ends up in prison for years
even though at each trial
the charges never stick to him
because all he's doing is announcing
that his hope in the resurrection
has been fulfilled in King Jesus.
This is hardly a crime.
But at this point the Roman legal
machine can't just turn him away
and so Paul ends up
appealing to Rome's highest court.

Now you would think that all this
prison time would be a setback for Paul
because his heartbeat is to be on the
road starting new Jesus' communities.

But the Spirit orchestrates
everything for good in this book.
And so the imprisonment gives Paul time
to have his most
important apostolic letters written.
And these become the way
that his missionary legacy is
carried on long after he dies.

Eventually Paul was
transferred as a prisoner to run
and after a (terrifying) near-death
voyage across the Mediterranean,
Paul ends up in house arrest in Rome
awaiting his delayed trial.

And so he's able to host in
quite a nice house regular meetings
that reach Jews and Gentiles.

And the books final words are about
how Paul is announcing the Kingdom of God
and boldly teaching all about
the Lord Jesus, the Messiah
totally unhindered;
all happening right
under Caesars nose in Rome.

The unified work of Luke
acts it does so much more
than give us a history
of Jesus and the early church.
He's showing how the Kingdom
of God came on earth as in heaven
through Jesus' life,
death and resurrection;
through the coming of His Spirit
to empower the church to
bear witness from Jerusalem
to the ends of the Earth.

And as Luke has told the story
he's given us scores of example
of what faithfulness
to King Jesus looks like.

It looks like sharing the good news
of the risen King Jesus
in word and in action.
It means forming
diverse Jesus' communities
where people of all kinds come together,
where they're (treated) equally
and give allegiance to King Jesus
and live by His teachings.

And all of this is done
by trusting in the power
and the guidance of the Spirit
to lead the way forward.
That's what the
book of Acts is all about.
